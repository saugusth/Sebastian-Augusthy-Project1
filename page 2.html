<h1>Cortical Visual Imparment</h1>
<p>Kids ages one to three years of age can be have this. My sister sarah has this.</p> 

<p>This is visual impariment that is of the occiptial lobe(back part of the brain) and not the eye.</p>

<p>For people who have this, they wont be able to fixate and follow and their response to stimulation like light may be poor. Since the occiptial lobe is impaired, people who have this cannot perceive the world around you. For example, if you see a orange ball with black strips, you know it must be a basketball because you perceived it. For people with this they would see the same orange ball with black strips but not be able to understand that it was a basketball because they could not perceive it.</p>
<h2>Causes</h2>
<p>Cortical Visual Imparment(CVI) is caused by damage to the gray matter, white matter or both. In my sisters case is it was caused by low oxygen to her at birth.</p>
